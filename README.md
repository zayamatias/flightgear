Files for joysticks/panels to be used with flightgear

If not done yet, create a 'js' group and add your user to it.

Copy files in /etc to the same directory structure (or just add the lines if that file is already existing in you setup)

Copy the other files under ~/.fgfs (your flighgear config dir) into the tree structure as in this repo.

You may need to reboot for this to happen.

Good luck!
