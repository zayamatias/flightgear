A couple of multiplayer tools for fun


MP.ay: Generates 10 GA planes around LEPP, which will follow a VFR pattern (taxi, takeoff, proceed to Visual Report Point, perform manoeuvres, return to Visual Approach Point, enter traffic pattern, and land). The route for each plane takes around 1 Hour. A Maximum of 10 planes is generated. Once the limit is reached, when a plane lands, another one takes its place.

radar_gui.py : External radar for multiplayer action, I run it on a Pi Zero W2 with Raspbian Lite connected to wifi (it needs internet connection), the .sh script is to launch it on headless mode upon boot of the PI.

Have Fun!
